# ShopCode
This is code for Enchantments Shop and Normaly Shop, with prices. I was bored and i was thinking to publish because i'm lenny as fuck. Btw is NukkitX

This have 2 options to pay: Level or Money *I think is only for enchants, i forgot... Anyway, is not full code, just a little to know how to do that thing.
And yeah, it's modals.*

Btw, last time i modified a little bit code of "original job", to be a little bit different. It's almost same and can be easy improved. *Have multi language support. It's shit implemented, i know/ Original is improved.*

And easy too easy to add to be functional. Multilanguage file is posted in other repository so then :) 

Btw, modal library is from FAWE, you can see imports. *GUI FOLDER*
